## Title: 
Gulp Task Challenge 

### Introduction:

In this coding challenge, you will be tasked with implementing a Gulp task that is meant to concatenate files from a source directory and save the concatenated output to a destination directory. Gulp is a popular JavaScript build tool that automates various development tasks. 

### Objectives:

- Explore the Gulp documentation to find and use  the necessary Gulp plugin for file concatenation.
- Implement a Gulp task to concatenate files located in the 'src/files' directory.
- Ensure the concatenated output is saved as 'all.js' in the 'dest/files' directory.

### Output:

Upon running the Gulp task successfully, you should find a file named 'all.js' in the 'dest/files' directory. This 'all.js' file will contain the concatenated content of the source files with extensions '.js', '.json', '.css', and '.html'.

### Notes/Hints:

You must place files with the following extensions in the 'src/files' directory for this task to work correctly: '.js', '.json', '.css', '.html'.
