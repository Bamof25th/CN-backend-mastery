Title: 
Node.js MVC Product Listing with Data Fetching

Introduction:
In a Node.js project following the MVC architecture, you are responsible for implementing two methods. The fetchProducts method in the ProductModel class should be completed to retrieve an array of products from the src/assets/products.js file. The getProducts method in the ProductController class should be completed to render the product.ejs template, displaying the product details in a table. This solution aims to create a product listing page with data fetched from a specific file.

Objectives:

1.Implement the fetchProducts method in the ProductModel class to fetch an array of products from the src/assets/products.js file.

2.Complete the getProducts method in the ProductController class to render the product.ejs template with the fetched product details displayed in a table.

3.Complete the "product.ejs" view to display the details of the products in a table.
