# Title:
 Node.js MVC Project - Fetching and Displaying Products

# Introduction:
    In this problem, you are working on a Node.js project that follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. The goal is to complete two tasks related to fetching and displaying products. The scenario involves building an API endpoint that responds with product data when a user sends a GET request to port 3000. The data is retrieved from a file called 'src/assets/products.js' and needs to be processed and returned in a specific format.

# Objectives:

    1.Implement the fetchProducts method in the ProductModel class to fetch an array of products from 'src/assets/products.js'.
    
    2.Complete the getProducts method in the ProductController class to respond with the fetched product data when a GET request is made to the root ('/') route on port 3000.
    
# Expected Output:
    When a user sends a GET request to the root ('/') route on port 3000, the application should return the product data retrieved from 'src/assets/products.js'. The output should be in the format shown in the provided image.

# Notes/Hints:

    1.Take a look at the provided default code to understand the existing structure and how the fetchProducts and getProducts methods are currently implemented.
    
    2.Use the 'src/assets/products.js' file to fetch the product data.
    
    3.Pay attention to the expected output format shown in the provided image for accurate implementation.
    
    4. Test your solution by making a GET request to the root ('/') route on port 3000 and verifying the returned data matches the expected output.
