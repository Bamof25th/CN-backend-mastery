# Title: 
    Node.js MVC Project - User Data Rendering

# Introduction:
    You are working on a Node.js project following the MVC architecture. The project involves fetching user data from the "https://dummyjson.com/users" API using Axios. Your task is to complete the implementation by enhancing the userController function in user.controller.js to render the fetched data. 
    The provided output example demonstrates the expected table format of the rendered user data.

# Objectives:
