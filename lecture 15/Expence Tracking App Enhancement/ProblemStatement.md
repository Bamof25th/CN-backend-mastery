Expense Tracking App Enhancement

### Introduction + Scenario

Imagine you're working on an expense tracking app. Currently, the app allows adding, fetching, filtering, and tagging expenses. However, the crucial functionalities of updating and deleting tags are missing. Your task is to implement these features using MongoDB and Node.js, ensuring efficient use of the pull operator for seamless expense management.

### Objectives

1. Integrate update functionality to modify tags in expenses.
2. Implement the ability to delete tags from expenses.
3. Utilize MongoDB and Node.js, focusing on optimizing with the pull operator.

### Expected Output

Output should look like: https://files.codingninjas.in/screencast-from-18-09-23-08-15-40-am-ist-31143.webm 

Enhance the expense tracking app to enable users to update and delete tags for expenses. Utilize MongoDB and Node.js to achieve this functionality, ensuring smooth modification and removal of tags using the pull operator.


### Resources

Refer to MongoDB and Node.js documentation for guidance on using the pull operator and updating/deleting data.

### Notes/Hints

1. Consider the structure of the existing expenses and tags in the database.
2. Research how to apply the pull operator to update or delete specific elements within an array.
