Title: Express Request Handler

Introduction:
Create a request handler in Express that can handle GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests. This functionality is crucial for building web applications that require different actions based on the type of request.

Objectives:

1.Implement a route handler for the '/' route.
2.Handle GET requests by responding with the message 'get'.
3.Handle POST requests by responding with the message 'post'.
4.Handle PUT requests by responding with the message 'put'.
5.Handle DELETE requests by responding with the message 'delete'.

Expected Output:

For each corresponding request, the server should respond with the respective message:

GET request: 'get'
POST request: 'post'
PUT request: 'put'
DELETE request: 'delete'

1.Use the Express framework's routing capabilities to handle different HTTP methods.
2.Pay attention to the request type and respond accordingly using appropriate Express functions.
3.Make sure to properly set up your project with the necessary dependencies and server configuration.
