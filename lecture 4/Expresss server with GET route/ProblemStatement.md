Title: Express Server with GET Route

Introduction:
You are tasked with creating an Express server and implementing a GET route. The server instance should be stored in a variable called "server." The scenario involves building a basic web application that responds with the message "Be a Coding Ninja" when accessed at the root ("/") endpoint.

Objectives:

1.Create an Express server instance and store it in a variable named "server."
2.Implement a GET route at the root ("/") endpoint.
3.Configure the GET route to respond with the message "Be a Coding Ninja."

Expected Output:
When the Express server is running, accessing the root ("/") endpoint should display the message "Be a Coding Ninja" as the response.

Notes/Hints:

Remember to install the necessary dependencies and start the server to test the implementation.
Make sure to use the correct syntax and follow Express conventions for creating the server and defining routes.
