Title: Express Server Middleware - Request Logging

Introduction:
In a web application, it is essential to log incoming requests for debugging and analysis purposes. You are given an Express server that listens on port 5000. Your task is to enhance the server by implementing a middleware function called "logRequest." This function should be executed for every GET request at the root ("/") path, logging the request method and path to the console. This feature will help monitor and track the incoming requests to the server.

Objectives:

1.Implement the "logRequest" middleware function.
2.Ensure the middleware is executed for every GET request at the root path ("/").
3.Log the request method (e.g., GET) and path (e.g., "/") to the console.

Expected Output:
When the server receives a GET request at the root path ("/"), the middleware should log the request method and path to the console.
