# Product Search Functionality Implementation in Node.js MVC Pattern

A developer wants to implement the search functionality in a Node.js application following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern. The search functionality involves a search bar inside the "views/layout.ejs" file, which takes user input and searches for matching products by their name. The search bar is implemented as a form that makes a POST request to the '/search' endpoint.
Help the developer in accomplishing this task.

# Tasks

    1.Create a view named "searchResult.ejs" to display the search results.

    2. The "searchResult.ejs" view should be responsible for rendering the search results in a user-friendly format.


    3. Modify the existing code to implement a search algorithm that filters products based on their name.

    4.Implement the 'search' controller inside the 'productcontroller.js' file to handle the POST request at the '/search' endpoint.
