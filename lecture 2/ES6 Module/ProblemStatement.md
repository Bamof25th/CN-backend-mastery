Title:
Updating Codebase to ES6 Module Syntax

Introduction:
You have received a codebase consisting of two files, app.js and math.js, which currently use CommonJS module syntax. Your objective is to update the codebase to comply with the ES6 module syntax. This is crucial as ES6 modules offer several advantages, such as improved encapsulation and better compatibility with modern JavaScript frameworks.

Objectives:

1.Refactor the codebase to use the ES6 module syntax.
2.Ensure that app.js imports and utilizes the exported functions from math.js correctly.

Expected Output:
The solution should produce the following output:
"The sum is 15"
"The mean is 3"
