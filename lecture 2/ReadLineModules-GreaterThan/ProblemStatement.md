Title: Maximum of Two Numbers using 'readline' module

Introduction:
Create an interface using the readline module to receive two numbers from the user. Calculate and log the maximum of the two numbers. This problem simulates a real-world scenario where user input needs to be processed and a result needs to be computed based on that input.

Objectives:

1.Implement an interface using the readline module to receive user input.
2.Extract two numbers from the user input.
3.Calculate the maximum of the two numbers.
4.Log the maximum value to the console.

Expected Output:

The program should display the maximum value of the two numbers entered by the user.
