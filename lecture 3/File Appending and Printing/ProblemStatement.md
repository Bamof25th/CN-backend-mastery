Title: File Appending and Printing

Introduction:
In this task, you are required to write a code snippet that handles a POST request. The code should append the request body to a file named "data.txt" and then print the contents of the file to the console. This functionality is particularly useful in scenarios where data needs to be stored and retrieved for further processing, such as logging or data persistence.

Objectives:

1.Complete the implementation of index.js to handle a POST request.
2.Read the request body and append it to the "data.txt" file.
3.Print the contents of the file to the console.

Expected Output:
Upon execution, the code should append the request body to the "data.txt" file and subsequently display the contents of the file on the console.
