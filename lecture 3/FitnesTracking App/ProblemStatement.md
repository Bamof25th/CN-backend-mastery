Title: Fitness Tracking Application: Goal Achievement Notification

Introduction:
You are working on a fitness tracking application and need to complete the implementation of the 'addExercise' function. The function should update the progress and emit a "goalReached" event when the user reaches their fitness goal. To motivate users, a congratulatory message should be sent upon reaching the goal. Your task is to implement the necessary functionality to track progress, emit events, and send the congratulatory message.

Objectives:

1. Implement the 'addExercise' function to update the progress.
2. Emit a "goalReached" event when the user reaches their fitness goal.
3. Set up a listener to send a congratulatory message when the goal is reached.

Expected Output:
Upon successful completion, the 'addExercise' function should update the progress and emit a "goalReached" event. A congratulatory message saying "Congratulations! You have reached your fitness goal" should be sent to the user.
